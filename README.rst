``ts_pre_commit_conf`` is a tool to generate configuration files for the pre-commit hooks for the Telescope and Site SoftWare (TSSW) team at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.


These configuration files facilitate ``pre-commit`` to maintain ``black`` formatting, ``flake8`` compliance and ``isort`` imports sorting.
If ``mypy`` is used, a configuration file can be generated for that as well.
The configuration files are generated by using the ``generate_pre_commit_conf`` command.
Since TSSW uses ``conda`` (or ``mamba``) for their software installations, a conda recipe was created for this project and the conda package was made available in the ``lsstts`` conda channel.
To enable this:

* Install pre-commit, for instance ``conda install -y pre-commit``.
* Install ``ts_pre_commit_conf``, for instance ``conda install -y -c lsstts ts-pre-commit-conf``.
* Then execute the ``generate_pre_commit_conf`` command.
  Note that this command accepts the ``-h`` or ``--help`` argument that will display usage information.

The configuration files will be updated whenever the pre-commit hooks get updated.
Apart from that, all generated configuration file names get added to ``.gitignore`` as well.
The TSSW Jenkins CI jobs update these configuration files and execute pre-commit every time the jobs run, so you know that you need to update them locally and fix your code if a job fails.
You can update the config file locally by running the ``generate_pre_commit_conf`` command again.
